# **CipherMesh â€“ Decentralized Cybersecurity Intelligence Network**

A blockchain-based protocol for real-time threat detection, smart contract auditing, and wallet protection powered by community-driven incentives.

---

## **Overview**

CipherMesh is a decentralized cybersecurity mesh built on Clarity smart contracts. It provides a trustless, automated layer for protecting Web3 users and protocols against exploits, scams, and vulnerabilities through an ecosystem of stakers, threat reporters, validators, and project maintainers.

The system consists of ten core smart contracts that coordinate registration, threat submission, bounty distribution, arbitration, scoring, and DAO governance.

## **Smart Contracts**

### **Registry Contract**

- Registers smart contracts and wallets for protection
- Stores verified audit hashes
- Assigns dynamic threat scores based on reports and history

### **Threat Reporting Contract**

- Enables submission of detailed threat reports
- Requires stake to prevent spam or abuse
- Emits evidence metadata (exploit vector, impact, etc.)

### **Bounty Pool Contract**

- Manages pooled rewards for valid reports
- Projects fund their own bounty pools
- Distributes bounties automatically upon validation

### **Stake & Slashing Contract**

- Manages stake deposits for reporters and validators
- Slashes stake for false or low-quality reports
- Rewards reporters with accurate findings

### **Reputation & Scoring Contract**

- Tracks reputation scores for contributors and projects
- Increases or decreases trustworthiness over time
- Affects scoring in registry and visibility in the ecosystem

### **Escalation & Arbitration Contract**

- Escalates disputed reports to a decentralized council
- Manages community-based resolution and fund redistribution
- Ensures fairness in high-stake situations

### **Subscription Contract**

- Enables continuous threat monitoring via payment plans
- Projects subscribe for regular scans and real-time alerts
- Automatically routes a portion to the bounty pool

### **DAO Governance Contract**

- Manages protocol parameters and settings
- Allows community proposals and on-chain voting
- Updates rules for staking, reporting, slashing, and rewards

### **Emergency Protocol Contract**

- Allows emergency alerts for critical threats
- Temporarily freezes or disables vulnerable smart contracts (if integrated)
- Can only be triggered with high-severity validated reports

### **Validator Node Registration Contract**

- Registers and rotates independent validator nodes
- Nodes are responsible for reviewing threat submissions
- Validators are slashed for inactivity or collusion

## **Features**

- Real-time community-based threat detection  
- Staking and slashing for accountability  
- Decentralized bounty and reward system  
- Smart contract risk scoring and reputation tracking  
- DAO-based governance and upgrades  
- Emergency kill-switch protocols  
- Subscription-based continuous protection

## **Installation**

1. Install Clarinet CLI  
2. Clone this repository  
3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. Deploy contracts:

    ```bash
    clarinet deploy
    ```

## **Usage**

Each smart contract is modular and can be deployed independently. Projects can register with the Registry Contract, fund bounties, and subscribe for monitoring. Reporters interact through the Threat Reporting and Staking Contracts. Validators handle verification and are rewarded for accurate validation. Escalations are managed through the Arbitration system, governed by a DAO.

See individual .clar files for function documentation and usage examples.

## **Testing**

Tests are written using Vitest and the Clarinet testing framework.

```bash
npm test
```
